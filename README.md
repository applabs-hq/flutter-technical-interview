# Flutter Technical Assessment

## Setup
`cd app`
`flutter pub get` to install dependencies

## Debugging
Run the `flutter` debug task

This should deploy and launch a flutter web instance at a unique port forwarded URL. 

If this doesn't auto launch, it is available in the debug console under the `ports` tab

## Hot reload
Hot reload does not work well with web and codespaces, you will need to refresh the page for changes to take effect
